This list if based off a series of posts to steem titled todays tabs, as of this update, the most recent post is here:

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/life/@sn0n/today-s-tabs-episode-4">https://steemit.com/life/@sn0n/today-s-tabs-episode-4</a> </p>
<p>Everything from these posts will be added to this growing list of yet to be sorted resources for things that I have personally found intersting or useful. 
I&#39;ll also be going through my bookmarks and adding those resources here as well, eventually adding the entire list to a steem post similar to the profile pages. </p>
<!-- todo: sort links on web directory --> 
</p>
<p>First up (oldest to newest tabs):<br>
Some motivational stuff.. Worth a look over for reminders and ideas<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.goalcast.com/2018/01/02/30-day-growth-challenge/amp/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.goalcast.com/2018/01/02/30-day-growth-challenge/amp/</a></p>
<p>Next is:<br>
More of the same... Does the theme break?<br>
<a href="https://nataliebacon.com/create-personal-development-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://nataliebacon.com/create-personal-development-plan/</a></p>
<p>And den...:<br>
Link seem to explain this one quite well<br>
<a href="https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/social-media-architecture-with-ipfs/4625" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/social-media-architecture-with-ipfs/4625</a></p>
<p>Next up:<br>
Some web dev for a popout? Expand css button thingie maschlopper<br>
<a href="https://codepen.io/woodwoerk/pen/adbyvG" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://codepen.io/woodwoerk/pen/adbyvG</a></p>
<p>And along comes:<br>
Oh boy, I just un-delegated my 400 SP, but I did love their service for its passive income properties.<br>
<a href="https://smartsteem.com/settings/delegation" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://smartsteem.com/settings/delegation</a> (edit:forgot the link)</p>
<p>Four to go:<br>
And to see where your delegations go..<br>
<a href="https://steembottracker.com/delegation.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://steembottracker.com/delegation.html</a></p>
<p>Ok, maybe Two:<br>
Time is money, friend. Amazing world of warcraft goblin quote. Auctioneers unite!! Million Gold club member.. Anyways, fun poll service <a href="/@dpoll">@dpoll</a> runs there<br>
<a href="https://dpoll.xyz/detail/@deathcross/how-much-reward-do-you-consider-fair-for-your-work/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="This link will take you away from steemit.com">https://dpoll.xyz/detail/@deathcross/how-much-reward-do-you-consider-fair-for-your-work/</a></p>
<p>And lastly:<br>
Some steem devs stuff<br>
<a href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@emrebeyler/tower-a-rest-api-implementation-on-the-top-of-hivemind">https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@emrebeyler/tower-a-rest-api-implementation-on-the-top-of-hivemind</a></p>
<p>If you enjoyed this post, cool. If you didnt,... Cool still snagged your time to read, may as well upvote me (;</p>
</div>

<p>First up in top of the list, I believe is a returning link, and that&#39;s one of them paywall sites after a certain number if viewed articles a month, not a fan of this, and medium is off the list for the most part because of this.. but
<a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/noble-eightfold-path/">https://tricycle.org/magazine/noble-eightfold-path/</a></p>
<p>A trend develops,... And out peacefully walks
<a href="https://buddha-dharma.org">https://buddha-dharma.org</a></p>
<p>Definitely a trend,...
<a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/5minbud.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/5minbud.htm</a></p>
<p>When will this trend break you say? Maybe soon... Ok, I think there are two more Buddhist related links... This guy wrote a book about sitting down and shutting up.
<a href="http://hardcorezen.info/desire-and-happiness/2955">http://hardcorezen.info/desire-and-happiness/2955</a></p>
<p>A steemian once wrote a nice eightfold path series. Definitely worth a follow and read. @revisesociology
<a href="https://steemit.com/@revisesociology">https://steemit.com/@revisesociology</a></p>
<p>And then along comes financial planning type stuff out of third field... Does that even exist? Been awhile since I&#39;ve baseballed..
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.treloaronline.com/blog/a-three-account-cash-flow-system-the-building-block-of-a-financial-plan%3fhs_amp=true">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.treloaronline.com/blog/a-three-account-cash-flow-system-the-building-block-of-a-financial-plan%3fhs_amp=true</a></p>
<p>This one is kind of back to the path. But in a different direction..
<a href="https://codingmindfully.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-meditation-for-programmers/">https://codingmindfully.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-meditation-for-programmers/</a></p>
<p>Ok, this is definitely the last path related link.. I promise
<a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/the-four-noble-truths-450095">https://www.learnreligions.com/the-four-noble-truths-450095</a></p>
<p>This is another tangent on a theme... A good one about flow
<a href="https://codingmindfully.com/keep-code-flowing-introduction-flow-programmers/">https://codingmindfully.com/keep-code-flowing-introduction-flow-programmers/</a></p>
<p>Feeling retro? Here comes some good old websites revived..
<a href="https://dev.to/kenbellows/rewriting-an-old-project-part-1-html-css-4o5p">https://dev.to/kenbellows/rewriting-an-old-project-part-1-html-css-4o5p</a></p>
<p>And then...
Along came a JavaScript search engine. Definitely worth a look for node/JavaScript devs
<a href="https://lucaongaro.eu/blog/2019/01/30/minisearch-client-side-fulltext-search-engine.html">https://lucaongaro.eu/blog/2019/01/30/minisearch-client-side-fulltext-search-engine.html</a></p>
<p>Followed by,
More JavaScript, this time about using json things.
<a href="https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/json-tutorial/">https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/json-tutorial/</a></p>
<p>Naturally then comes,..
Gotta get the structure of the building figured out, of course that building is a JavaScript file.
<a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html</a></p>
<p>Then comes some of that new kid on the block.
Did ya&#39;ll say PWA? Here is a page to test your page. How meta.
<a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190419_S1_44220f02e021883d13ab1d4bb5905046/">https://www.webpagetest.org/result/190419_S1_44220f02e021883d13ab1d4bb5905046/</a></p>
<p>Ok, I know what I said..
Just read the url text and continue along another path if you will..
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yogajournal.com/.amp/yoga-101/12-yin-yoga-poses-for-energy-recharge-your-practice">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yogajournal.com/.amp/yoga-101/12-yin-yoga-poses-for-energy-recharge-your-practice</a></p>
<p>These are a thing..
The official docs do exist, they need a bit of work, hit they are looking better from what I can tell
<a href="https://developers.steem.io/tutorials-javascript/get_post_details">https://developers.steem.io/tutorials-javascript/get_post_details</a></p>
<p>This one was unexpected..
Microsoft went chrome with edge.
<a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download">https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download</a></p>
<p>Did you know...
That random Google questions result in random useful sites.. lots of advertising ish.. probably some sponsored stuff. But useful nontheless.
<a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/free-node-js-hosting/">https://makeawebsitehub.com/free-node-js-hosting/</a></p>
<p>Then,..
Stoic I believe is the word, it&#39;s always appears misspelled to me. Anywho, here&#39;s some philosophy from a random blog online.
<a href="http://sandordargo.com/blog/2019/05/01/be-severe-only-with-yourself">http://sandordargo.com/blog/2019/05/01/be-severe-only-with-yourself</a></p>
<p>Then more of that..
JavaScript stuff. This one is about reading and writing files, obviously right, you can read urls...
<a href="https://tutorialedge.net/javascript/nodejs/reading-writing-files-with-nodejs/">https://tutorialedge.net/javascript/nodejs/reading-writing-files-with-nodejs/</a></p>
<p>Naturally leading to some of that,..
DOM JavaScript juju
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-access-elements-in-the-dom">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-access-elements-in-the-dom</a></p>
<p>And haxx near the end..
Well, life hacks about goals, this one about making progress, funny bit about that though, even a step is progress, dunno why an article is needed, but someone wrote one, and I had it&#39;s tab open!
<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/6-simple-steps-to-make-progress-towards-achieving-a-goal.html">https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/6-simple-steps-to-make-progress-towards-achieving-a-goal.html</a></p>
<p>The end of the road,..
Been reading up on IPFS things.. they have a roadmap ya know
<a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/78-ipfs-2019-roadmap/">https://blog.ipfs.io/78-ipfs-2019-roadmap/</a></p>
<p>Up first is:
<a href="https://tc39.github.io">https://tc39.github.io</a>
This is a JavaScript specifications documentation or something. Haven&#39;t checked it out yet.</p>
<p>And in 2nd:
<a href="https://steemd.com/@sn0n">https://steemd.com/@sn0n</a>
So this last few days, I&#39;ve gone 1% upvote on all posts of those I follow. This is manual curation on steemit.com as an Android app (add to homescreen, so no browser tabs n shit), for some reason, I still use this site to monitor my voting power. Note to self: include that on blokz/demo</p>
<p>Rounding 3rd:
<a href="https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/how-i-wrote-a-technical-book-in-under-200-hours-911d5e4f9e8c">https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/how-i-wrote-a-technical-book-in-under-200-hours-911d5e4f9e8c</a>
Another of my many projects is get a book done, I&#39;ve got enough content to fill a book... But... It needs a LOT of organizing, and it would probably be novella size,.. in any event..</p>
<p>Quatro:
<a href="http://steem.supply/@sn0n">http://steem.supply/@sn0n</a>
I do have this open as a steemd replacement...</p>
<p>And then...:
<a href="https://areknawo.com/the-art-of-problem-solving/">https://areknawo.com/the-art-of-problem-solving/</a>
I&#39;ve always said that paying attention, taking notes, and engaging is how to learn.... Haven&#39;t checked out the article yet, maybe my comment is off base.</p>
<p>Another:
<a href="https://steemprojects.com">https://steemprojects.com</a>
Seems kinda obvious from the.url, but for the real slow people, it&#39;s a list of things...</p>
<p>An den:
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest">https://news.ycombinator.com/newest</a>
Hacker news FTW.. recently uninstalled Reddit... Found a fun alternative... Also using Google news. I do keep switching up my news outlets as I want to get my information from as many sources as possible.. I could rant about that for awhile... But maybe in another post.</p>
<p>Next!:
<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">https://coinmarketcap.com</a>
I know I switched to another site ages ago, but I haven&#39;t checked bookmarks for it yet, and know this URL back of my hand status...</p>
<p>And:
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/running-node-js-on-wsl-from-visual-studio-code/">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/running-node-js-on-wsl-from-visual-studio-code/</a>
So recently got a Win10 desktop, always been a Linux user, needed to get some action going on, figured since I wanted a windows box for testing.. I may as well ^&gt;^</p>
<p>Finally:
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/running-nodejs-on-linux-on-windows-88bd12993bae">https://hackernoon.com/running-nodejs-on-linux-on-windows-88bd12993bae</a>
A article which I think lead to me finding the previous link (I do these in reverse order, maybe I should start from the top next time... Not first in last out (FILO).</p>
<p>First up,
JavaScript has alot of promise. How punny, but really, this helps with page loads, with JavaScript making a pledge to return some results after the elves work...
<a href="https://superjavascript.com/t/javascript-promises/">https://superjavascript.com/t/javascript-promises/</a></p>
<p>And den,
This one is some cliff notes on a programmers how to life book
<a href="https://github.com/n0ruSh/the-art-of-reading/issues/12">https://github.com/n0ruSh/the-art-of-reading/issues/12</a></p>
<p>Next up,
Free graphics for web developer or bloggers, just saying.. could spice up your posts! Maybe I&#39;ll find one to use for these posts before I post this...
<a href="https://gallery.manypixels.co">https://gallery.manypixels.co</a></p>
<p>Followed by,
Some steem monsters research, gotta enter the battlefield prepared after all, lots of good info
<a href="https://steemit.com/gaming/@tribe9/steem-monsters-everything-you-need-to-know-in-one-place">https://steemit.com/gaming/@tribe9/steem-monsters-everything-you-need-to-know-in-one-place</a></p>
<p>Speaking of,
Steem stuff, here&#39;s a link to checkout what an account is up to in a clear and concise way..
<a href="http://www.steemreports.com/account-votes/">http://www.steemreports.com/account-votes/</a></p>
<p>What&#39;s this,
Oh, so I started watching Legion on Hulu, AMAZING show, if you know nothing of it, and don&#39;t like spoilers, watch it before doing any research at all into it and go in completely blind, but if spoilers are your thing... Rabbit hole?
<a href="https://legion.fandom.com/wiki/Melanie_Bird">https://legion.fandom.com/wiki/Melanie_Bird</a></p>
<p>Or maybe,
JavaScript is your thing? Checkout this shell... Cool for mobile I guess, desktops have many better options, but a cool site nontheless
<a href="https://jsconsole.com">https://jsconsole.com</a></p>
<p>most definitely,
When programming for steem in JavaScript, this page is helpful, needs better examples and demos, but eh. One day. Maybe I could work on documentation... I enjoy that kinda shit.
<a href="https://github.com/steemit/steem-js/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/steemit/steem-js/blob/master/README.md</a></p>
<p>or this,
Programming stuff, haven&#39;t had a chance to glance at this one yet, I remember opening it then switching tasks.
<a href="https://medium.com/@lachlanmiller_52885/build-social-media-platform-with-the-steem-blockchain-2-posting-a-comment-to-the-blockchain-43521bda8463">https://medium.com/@lachlanmiller_52885/build-social-media-platform-with-the-steem-blockchain-2-posting-a-comment-to-the-blockchain-43521bda8463</a></p>
<p>naturally comes,
One of the definitive sources for JS information, have any other better ones? Google has a js developer portal also I believe... Eh, getting distracted
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction</a></p>
<p>Slowly getting there,
As I mentioned a couple days ago, back on here with my delegations..
<a href="https://smartsteem.com/dashboard">https://smartsteem.com/dashboard</a></p>
<p>Then along came,
Some promotional marketing getting better stuff.. I think? Haven&#39;t looked at this one either, but seems relevant
<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-boost-your-portfolio-with-github-pages-and-lighthouse-8e20ca69985b">https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-boost-your-portfolio-with-github-pages-and-lighthouse-8e20ca69985b</a></p>
<p>Coming up,
A codepen clone of sorts I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at, someone let me know what ya think.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/pachacamac/0f1592cd12cc3bf2c10259ecce8127ee">https://gist.github.com/pachacamac/0f1592cd12cc3bf2c10259ecce8127ee</a></p>
<p>Up next,
This one is good for showing what code does in documentation and such.. embedded code samples on your page style.
<a href="https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/">https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/</a></p>
<p>Naturally along came,
This next one I may have mentioned before, it let&#39;s you code a site and share a URL that has that site embedded in the URL essentially...
<a href="https://itty.bitty.site/edit">https://itty.bitty.site/edit</a>
Sample, <a href="https://itty.bitty.site/#Steemit_example/?XQAAAAJNAQAAAAAAAAAkGUmYbxAZxtbQ4H/2h1tK/YH0ihTEl5CqJdazf9SlcqaEgt7M97RzJGt9Wl9q2ZOyw4gHWz9z98/S+54cFHZg2cDvP9hG7GlbV9PQoDM/unozbQ/u1+86ul8EQMlLl7MyPTez+E0IKFbN65hS1mVSjd1pV1+gFB5EyAgCG3E2MFWx4hCpAKuoC819WiRRsxWErzOqzqo+heuBWzJ/jh90oAdlUDXG3xOXV7uYfJwgLLlHjzeokeh5X9x1WpNorZ8l/zh2e2mhUpstX2EoxhMiTlxS8ajU7j2WVLFhdVyJAEM5DEB5vV9HSK+78xtlATEq5h5Jzq3f62++ulO//+Logj4=">https://itty.bitty.site/#Steemit_example/?XQAAAAJNAQAAAAAAAAAkGUmYbxAZxtbQ4H/2h1tK/YH0ihTEl5CqJdazf9SlcqaEgt7M97RzJGt9Wl9q2ZOyw4gHWz9z98/S+54cFHZg2cDvP9hG7GlbV9PQoDM/unozbQ/u1+86ul8EQMlLl7MyPTez+E0IKFbN65hS1mVSjd1pV1+gFB5EyAgCG3E2MFWx4hCpAKuoC819WiRRsxWErzOqzqo+heuBWzJ/jh90oAdlUDXG3xOXV7uYfJwgLLlHjzeokeh5X9x1WpNorZ8l/zh2e2mhUpstX2EoxhMiTlxS8ajU7j2WVLFhdVyJAEM5DEB5vV9HSK+78xtlATEq5h5Jzq3f62++ulO//+Logj4=</a></p>
<p>Then along came,
More learning stuff. Have you noticed how much I love consuming information?
<a href="https://github.com/mikesprague/udacity-nanodegrees/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/mikesprague/udacity-nanodegrees/blob/master/README.md</a></p>
<p>This happened,
Along came some steem changes, namely....
<a href="https://steemitwallet.com/market">https://steemitwallet.com/market</a></p>
<p>Attention what?
Sorry, another distraction, and some self promoting in my tabs I guess, I was probably checking out @steempeak
<a href="https://steempeak.com/@sn0n/breaking-news-steem-wallet-changes">https://steempeak.com/@sn0n/breaking-news-steem-wallet-changes</a></p>
<p>Nearing the end,
So my daughter is part of this MLM mob, they go gang gang bang bang!! Jk, it&#39;s some health and beauty products, but they basically MANUALLY follow and message hundreds of Instagram accounts a day.... So I figured I&#39;d show her she COULD automate it...
<a href="https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py/blob/master/README.md</a></p>
