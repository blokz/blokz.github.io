    <p><h3>Mind</h3></p>
<p>Organizing our Habits! Today&#39;s focus is on Organizing what needs to be organized in our life, and the habits that we use to enable or hinder ourselves. It&#39;s hard to say where to begin as far as organizing, but I&#39;ve found that my living space is a good start. Making changes to your environment is the first thing to be done when &#39;something needs to change&#39;,.. starting with Air (Breathing), Water, Food, Sleep, Clothing, Shelter. Going right down the list, 10 minutes a day (even 1 minute 10 times a day) listening to and slowing your breathing is enough to start. Water is the same, as we&#39;ve mentioned from day 1, just try to drink a little more water then the day before. Food is a bit harder to manage, just try to make better choices as mentioned in the daily body section. Sleep depends on a few factors, entertainment and distractions being a hard one for most of us in this day and age, a good starting point is if you are getting less then 7 hrs a night, try to get to at least 7.. and try to waste less time if thats part of the problem... these are the times we need to re-evaluate our use of time,.. prioritize sleep, then up to 4 1/2 hours to work on your Mind Body and Spirit, a hour and a half each, some activities satisfy all 3 aspects.. this is typically when you are in flow. When life &amp; time just stops and you are fully engaged in the moment. Chase those moments.. And on to Shelter, which is where organizing comes in, starting with your sleeping area then moving to rest room and finally shifting focus in the cooking area, other areas exist and obviously include those areas that need your attention. Please do not panic and say things like &quot;omg this is too much to do, I&#39;ll never get there&quot; or &quot;someone else will get to it&quot;, they aren&#39;t productive nor conductive to the universe sending energies to get the tasks done. CHUNK the work into smaller blokz using your task and todo lists. Everything from cleaning the dishes you use when making meals, to making the sleeping area when you wake up for the day, as they say when going out into nature, &quot;Leave it like you found it, or better.&quot;<br />
As you work through the organizing of your various life blokz (self, environment, other), you will find that habits that you have, do not serve your goals and dreams, be mindful of them and try to do better then the day before on them. You can use a Check mark and X style tracking, or however you want to punish and reward yourself, a Task/ Todo app that can do A LOT of this for you is Habitica, which can be found on the Android &amp; IOS markets. Give it a peep. Know that habits aren&#39;t going to change overnight, it will take some time.. just like eating better and drinking more water then the day before. Just keep trying to do better, Notes/Journal/Apps can help alot with this task, track everything you want to work on over time in some form...

<h3>Body</h3>
<em>-_-/</em>
<p>Diet? Still not sure what that is,... but did you drink more water then yesterday? and I think something about maybe at a little healthier in either portion size or something like adding fruits and veggies to meals... snacking on nuts and berries...</p>


<p><h3>Spirit</h3>
^_^(Om) <strong>Namaste</strong><br />
Enjoy all moments, life is too short to hate with negative intent. Be kind, Both to yourself &amp; others.</p>
