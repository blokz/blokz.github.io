    <p><h3>Overview</h3>       </p>
<p>Basic Daily Timeline will be something like this : </p>
        <table class="mdl-data-table mdl-js-data-table mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin: 15px">
            <thead>

          </table>
<p>For now, I&#39;ll at minimum be asking for 45 minutes a day, Mind - 5-10 min to read this page, Body - 30ish min to do some exercise, and Spirit - 10 min to be with yourself, Anything past that is all on you, and strictly encouraged. ;-) IMO the best time of day to do the plan would be first thing in the morning, before breakfast, but whatever works for you is fine by me too. Mind body and Spirit are used in a few.</p>

<p><h3>Mind </h3>
        <p>Each day will start with reading the days section from the development plan, which may include watching youtube, reading some words here, taking notes and some other activities outside the box you are reading this on. A journal, index cards, or something to write notes on is suggested, but as with anything in life, or on this website, how you track your progress is up to you, we can only provide the tools for your toolbox. How you use them, or not, is your own choice. Remember why you are here taking on this task, not because it&#39;s free, but from some desire within yourself.</p>
        <p>The goal with this development plan as mentioned will be focused on life maintenance. Looking at your Goals &amp; Dreams. Then Starting from the basics of eating, sleeping, drinking, breathing.. moving to problem solving.. and budgeting everything from time to money and friends (energy vampires anyone?).. and we wouldnt dare leave out how to find fun and enjoyment in things (hint: gratitude)!!! Each week has a main focus, but some days may have a heavy focus on other topics, possibly not even mentioning the weekly topic. <br />
        As with learning, some tools will be given to us far before we know how to use it.. but its <strong>fun</strong> to look at and read the manual a little on a tool before applying it to its task.. small circles and chess.. more on that later.</p>
<p><h3>Body</h3>
<a href="../assets/images/yoga-poses.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/yoga-poses.jpg" width="400"/></a><br />
<span>Yoga poses (Click for large version <a href="http://www.teenytinyom.com/2013/03/04/asanas-poster/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</span></p>
<p>A few moments of focus. Listening to your breathing or improving your mind and body otherwise. You will find a daily yoga routine drawn from portions of a much better plan in the back of : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805210318/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805210318&linkCode=as2&tag=blokz-20&linkId=660246cebc10fd1d93592f70e4b28cdb">Light on Yoga: The Bible of Modern Yoga</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=blokz-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0805210318" width="1" height="1" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If you do buy the book and start the 300 week Asana Courses, skip the yoga section of this Development plan. I&#39;ll also be including links to guided meditations and other resources to try outside of your normal routine. </p>
<p><strong>ujjayi tadasana - Victorious Breath Mountain Pose</strong><br />
Pretty simple! We shall stand, ready to take on the world.. an appropiate end to todays reading. <br />
Ujjayi: you begin with a full slow and steady breath into the lungs, as breathing in, suck yer belly button towards yer spin. Hold for a second or two as your lungs hit full (do not overfill your gas tank). With your exhale, slow and steady wins the race, and same for this breath, A second or so into the exhale, begin to also slowly release your grip on your belly button until fully relaxed as the last bit of air escapes. Hold for a second or two with no air in your lungs and repeat slow and steadily...<br />
tadasana: This one is easy mate, stand there... TADA!!! yer a mountain! nothing can move you, not even an unstoppable force... 
</p>
<p>Now that air &amp; exercise are out of the way, what else does the body NEED? Food, Water and Sleep... for today, just try to eat a little better then yesterday, maybe a smaller portion,.. whatever works for you, no big drastic changes, maybe try skipping cheese on your meal, or add in some more veggies,... same for water, maybe start with just replacing one glass a day of your favorite drink with water, or for today, just lookin at some water and thinking about it. Slow and Steady is whats going to win this race, not a huge drastic change, but we&#39;ll check in on the water progress and food progress.. and then there was sleep,... well,... life is pretty crazy sometimes, and sleep schedules are everyones opinion, try to get relaxed uninterrupted sleep for at least 6 hrs a night, aim for 7 or 8. </p>

<p><h3>Spirit</h3></p>
<p>The final of three parts of what makes us. These three parts will be a focus in the development plan, for us to be successful, all three must be in balance and harmonic. The <strong>Mind</strong> is essentially what we know, how we use it, etc.. <strong>Body</strong>, is our mental and physical health &amp; fitness, maintence of the physical body to make it at least to our 10 year goal. <strong>Spirit</strong> is our focus on goals and dreams, what drives us, our essence. </p>
<p>Most of the daily exercises will ask you to go inside your head, ask yourself questions, and plot a course for yourself to follow on a personal development path, A portion of our focus is on life maintenance and enjoying the game that is life. Once you have maintenance and enjoyment figured out, the skies the limit as to what you can achieve..</p>

<p><h3>Today&#39;s Exercise<h3></p>
<p><strong><em> Be the mountain for 10 minutes</strong> Set a timer on your phone or egg timer thing in your kitchen for ten minutes, and practice that breathing technique.. when thoughts come, think about what you have seen here today, what your goals and dreams are. I believe in you, and you got this!  <br />
<strong></em> Freewrite for 10 minutes on Goals &amp; Dreams</strong></p>
